# ArithMatic Language

### This is basically a programming language, but not really.

I am creating this project to practice creating a basic interpreter that has a lexer, that passes tokens to a parser, that passes instructions to the interpreter to execute.

## Usage

```console
aml % php file.php test.math
// prints tokens...
```

```console
aml % php shell.php
> 2 + 2
// prints tokens...
> _
```

# ArithMetic Language

### This is basically a programming language, but not really.

I am creating this project to practice creating a basic interpreter that has a lexer, that passes tokens to a parser,
that passes instructions to the interpreter to execute.

## Usage

Interactive shell:

```console
aml % php aml
```

... or use a file:

```console
aml % php aml test.aml
```
